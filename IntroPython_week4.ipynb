Tuples are useful when you want to make sure something cannot accidentally get modified, and we will use them when we learn about functions (hopefully) this class."

    "Say, for instance, you are interested in seeing how voltage to calcium transformations occur in your favorite neuron. You run some pre-processing code on a large batch of 2p imaging data is paired with some simultaneous E-phys recordings, and you would typically let the code run overnight since it takes a lot of computing power.  However, some subset of your imaging data does not have any e-phys recordings that are paired with it, and your code will throw an error when you don't have that happening. \n",

    "A lot of people would just let it run overnight, come back the next day, and find that they have only processed 20/150 files because on the 21st file, it stopped running because you ran into an error of missing the e-phys data. They would then be like, \"aw gosh, that sucks! I'll just check my data more thoroughly the next time I run this!\" and then it would happen maybe like 20 more times to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "But YOU? This would only ever happen to you ONCE because you know about ```continue``` and ```pass``` statements!*** So, to avoid ever running into this problem ever again, you would just check to see if there is a e-phys recording, and if there isn't, then to ```pass``` the loop that would process the e-phys recording so you don't get thrown an error that would stop the entire preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note that there are many ways to avoid this; you don't have to use ```continue, pass or break``` statements. I was just trying to think of an example. I personally would probably use a combination of ```try/except``` and ```break/continue/pass``` statements. \n",
